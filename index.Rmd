# Introduction  
The goal of this assignment is to create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. The webpage should be hosted on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. The webpage must also contain the date when the document was created.

## My Map for Locating Jantar Mantar in Jaipur (INDIA)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lat = 26.921496314, lng = 75.821330048, popup = "Jantar Mantar (Jaipur)")
